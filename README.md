Diploma work
=====================
The project is based on the task to the diploma project of the University of netology course PHP / SQL: back-end development and database (performed without additional task). This project allows users to view questions and answers by category and ask new questions. The administrator panel allows you to manage categories (add / remove) and questions for each category (view, edit, publish, delete). The full assignment is [here](https://netology-university.bitbucket.io/php/graduate-work/faq/index.html).
